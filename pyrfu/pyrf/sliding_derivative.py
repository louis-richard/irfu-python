def sliding_derivative(
    time_series, t_units: str = "ns", window_size=3, method: str = "window"
):
    """
    Compute the sliding time derivative of a time series using central differences.

    This function calculates the rate of change of a time series at each point by
    computing the derivative within a sliding window of a specified size. The derivative
    at each point is estimated using the first and last points in the window (central
    difference).

    Parameters:
    ----------
    time_series : xarray.DataArray
        The time series data for which the derivative is to be calculated.
    t_units: str, optional, default: "ns"
        The units of the time coordinate in time_series. If t_units is "ns" then the
        time is converted to seconds.
    window_size : int, optional, default: 3
        The number of data points in each sliding window. It should be an odd integer
        to ensure a symmetric window around the central point for central differences.

    Returns:
    -------
    derivative : xarray.DataArray
        An array containing the sliding derivative for each point in the time series.
        The length of this array matches the length of `time_series`. For points near
        the boundaries (where a full window cannot be formed), the result will be NaN.

    Notes:
    ------
    - The derivative is approximated using central differences for points that can
    accommodate the window size. For edge points, the output will contain NaN.
    - The function assumes `time_steps` are evenly spaced but works for irregular time
    steps as well by calculating the actual time difference between the start and end
    of the window.
